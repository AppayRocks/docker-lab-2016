# Cascon Docker Lab
In this lab you will explore the fundamental concepts of Docker containers, and
running multiple containers using Docker Compose.  The final part of this session will be a live demo
of using Docker Swarm.  The sample application you will be building in this workshop is a simple microservice with its own gateway, runtime
and database.

There are three parts to this lab.

## Part 1

[Lab 1](part-1/README.md) - Basic Docker lab, and creating a container with a web server

## Part 2
[Lab2](part-2/README.md) - Docker compose and building multiple containers that work together into a microservice

## Part 3
[Demo](part-3) using Docker Swarm 1.12 to turn a group of VMs into a single virtual Docker engine.
